# Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the examples below for the exact format your answers should take. There shouldn't be a space before the period.
# Remember that you can convert the numbers to strings using the function str

# Read an integer:
 a = int(input())
 b = a+1
 c= a-1

# Print a value:
 print('The next number for the number '+str(a)+' is '+str(b))
 print('The previous number for the number '+str(a)+' is '+str(c))
