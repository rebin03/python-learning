# Given three integers, determine how many of them are equal to each other. The program must print one of these numbers: 3 (if all are the same), 2 (if two of them are equal to each other and the third is different) or 0 (if all numbers are different).

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if a==b==c:
    print(3)
elif a==b or a==c or b==c:
    print(2)
else:
    print(0)
